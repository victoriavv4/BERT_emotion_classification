# BERT_emotion_classification

The purpose of this project was to classify unlabelled tweets with one of 4 emotions (Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear).
Several classification models were trained using frequency vectorization (TF-IDF) and evaluated.
After sub-optimal evaluation scores, BERT vectorization was used to determine if more context aware vectorization approaches would yeild better results.
Following evaluation comparisons, the SVC classification model with BERT vectorization was used to classify the unlabelled dataset.
